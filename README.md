### Semester One Guide

For C programming, go to the folder named ```SemesterOne``` and then select the ```CProgrammingNotes``` to get the notes for understanding the basics of C and everything covered above. For exercises, click on ```CProgrammingExercises``` and then onto ```LabSessions```. This will cover my answers to the labs and how I got there. It will also include some tips and things to look out for. The ```CExercises``` are the official exercises made by the university for extra practice (these are the downloadable .zip folders in Canvas).

For C++, select ```CppProgrammingNotes``` and follow the same instructions as above. (Still under construction)

Mock Exams are in their own separate folder as well as solutions, all of which are stored in the ```MockExams``` sub-folder
