/*
 * Program: Check if three integers are equal
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Uses logical OR (||) and inequality (!=) operators.
 * logical OR works by evaluating to true if at least one condition is true.
 * If any pair of numbers are not equal -> they are not all equal, making the program simple and efficient.
